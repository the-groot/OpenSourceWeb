    <p>Hello! In this homework, I want to tell you some symptoms of covid-19
    that I had suffered.</p>
    <ul>
       <li>Headache</li>
       <li>Chills</li>
       <li>Sore throat</li>
       <li>Back pain</li>
       <li>Cough</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you caught covid-19, you will be very sick for 3 days.</p>
    <p>But It will be get better after 3 days. It's better to take medicine if you
